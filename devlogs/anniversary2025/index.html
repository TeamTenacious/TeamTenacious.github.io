                    <p>Hello there, tenacious travelers! It's hard to believe, but it’s been a whole year since the conception of the project. A year is quite a long period of time, and during it we learned a lot about game development. It is not easy. At all. Anyway, we're ready to tell about the things that we have done!
</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="align-center">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <h1 class="align-center">= Jack’s designs =</h1>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>You may have noticed that we’ve shown two different designs for our favourite tenacious kiddo: one with a brown bomber jacket and one with a dark bluish-purple leather jacket. This was due to an expressed desire among the team to add some more visual flair to our protagonist. In the end, we settled on reverting the design to the classic jacket. To people who liked his redesign; don't worry, because it'll still be used in the game. How? You’ll know when the game is released. So stay tuned, alright?</p>

                    <p>As you can see, not much has been done, to put it mildly. Admittedly, this was due to a shortage in staff. Unfortunately, many important people have just left and the rest don't seem very motivated. The project has been close to dead for the last several months, but good news! We're back!! And we're hiring!!! If you're looking to work on the single best undertale fangame since that one with the fox, let us know!</p>
