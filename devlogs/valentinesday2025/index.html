                    <br>
                    <p>Happy Valentines Day!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It's been around three months since the inception of the project, and, personally, it's been some of the best months of my life. 
                    I've had the pleasure of working with incredible people; coders, artists, musicians, personally inspiring me to strive for more, and 
                    not settle for less.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We've gained a very sizable following despite not having a public build of the game, and for that, we couldn't be happier. Regardless,
                    our goal until we get a playable demo out is to share as much as we can, characters, footage, music, and more to foster a community that 
                    can feel the satisfaction of being there through thick and thin to see this project come to reality.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, let's get down to brass tacks and discuss the development of Undertale: Tenacious Road.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="align-center">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <h1 class="align-center">= GAMEPLAY =</h1>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I don't think it needs to be stated that frankly, writing code to emulate a game in an entirely seperate engine is extremely
                    difficult.
                    Despite this and many other setbacks, our coding team has been working around the clock to have sizable progress at the end of each day.
                    And at the current moment, this is what we feel comfortable to be shown publicly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So, let's take a look.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <iframe width="100%" height="500" class="image-center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGRTqNSEM3w?si=RBTT10gU5OmMNBb3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <br>
                    <p class="sneaky align-center">This room is just for testing! You will not see this in the actual game. Trust me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>What you saw there was a demonstration of our battle transition system, coded by
                    <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexiabel.com" style="color:#FFFF00; font-size: 1rem; font-family: main-font; text-decoration: none;">alexiabel</a>
                    and concepted by
                    <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewyeoak.com" style="color:#FFFF00; font-size: 1rem; font-family: main-font; text-decoration: none;">wyeoak</a>.
                    Our goal in this was to adapt Deltarune's smooth battle transitions into a format that worked in the Undertale battle style, and I believe we achieved that.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay, this is all we have to show for this newsletter. The truth is, we've been working under the hood, making improvements
                    to gameplay and Undertale parity that aren't very entertaining to show here...</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>But, we do have</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2 class="align-center">MUSIC</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>In terms of music, it's slow but steady progress being made. You can't rush art, you know. But today, we have some tracks ready to be shown off, and I can't wait for you to hear them.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>It's an amazing track, but I hope you never hear this ingame.</p>

                    are actually more than two in the files of the game! And played at various points ingame after major story events, the menu theme grows more and more full of life.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That's all we have to show now in terms of music, but there's lots more to see.</p>

                    and a character we don't want to reveal quite yet.</p>

                    <p>Speaking of Bella... She's been redesigned by a new artist on our team,

                    She's a fierce fighter, don't let her size fool you. It's a shame she won't be present in the game until Snowcapped... Which is after the Citadel... 
                    Which is after the Pipeworks...</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But, we do have a pair of characters you'll see sooner, and I'm sure you'll love them aswell.</p>

                    <p>Two royal guards, husband and husband, trapped within the confines of The Citadel as it all went to hell. As the militia took over
                    the city in Asgore's absence, Toriel hidden away in her own section of the ruins, it was prime for the taking by one bad actor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The militia destroyed all the exits to the region that were available to them, even in the Pipeworks, to prevent monsters from 
                    leaving and telling the royal guard what was going on.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So when Libel and Miao see a human coming up from the Pipeworks, they don't see a soul to take to the king, they see a means of escape.</p> 
                    <br> 
                    <p>Not just for them, but for every monster trapped in the Citadel.</p>

                    <p>Libel and Miao are just two dorks in the midst of a bad situation. Miao only joined the royal guard because he was swooning over Libel... 
                    But other than that, they would kill for each other. They would die for each other.</p>

                    the same person that made our animated teaser when we first started this project.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="sneaky">Seriously, thank you Leafaine. You're amazing.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>In retrospect, I probably shouldve implemented a subway surfers toggle for this whole article. Wow, that was a lot of reading!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But in turn, I hope you, the reader, got joy, a laugh, or excitement out of this newsletter I've put together with help from our amazing team. That's all I can hope for.</p>
                    <p>Because you, our fans, are the grease behind the gears. Taking the time out of your day to listen to me ramble on and on with pretty pictures, I couldn't thank you enough.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I hope there will be a copy of our game on your computer, one day. </p>
